# Password Locker

## Description

This project is about making an application that stores different account credentials for a user. This application is run in the command line, which allows the user to create an account to log into with their first  name and a password. 
It then allows the user to store in their different account credentials, so that they can view them, and delete them one they don't need them anymore. 
In case the user wishes to create new credentials, the application gives them an option of generating a password automatically, as sometimes we run out of ideas when it comes to creating a large number of passwords
